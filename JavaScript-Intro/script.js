// Javascript build-in types
// A type is a particular data structure
// JS has 8 build-in types 
// 7 primitives and 1 object type 
//Primitive types represents a single immutable value - this means once it's set it can't be change. value becomes read only
//you can create another value based on the existing one in memory


let number  = 10; // this is an assignment operator (=) 
// let number = 5;
console.log(number)
// num variable
// a variable is a container that holds a value

/**
